# DCMA-CNNs
a demo code of model DCMA-CNNs

## Brief Introduction
This is the code with respect to the model DCMA-CNNs, which is proposed in the paper: [\<Facial Expression Recognition Using Hierarchical Features With Deep Comprehensive Multipatches Aggregation Convolutional Neural Networks\>](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8371638)

## Settings
* The model is developed in MATLAB. Experiments are conducted on MATLAB 2014a.
* Experiments were all run on hardware with 8GB RAM and a single 2.5GHz CPU.
* The code is based on the [DeepLearnToolBox](https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/DeepLearnToolbox)
* This code is a brief demo of DCMA-CNNs. I only include six samples (all sampled from the JAFFE dataset) to show how DCMA-CNNs works (training and evaluation).
* Experiments (details refer to the paper) are conducted on two facial expression datasets: [CK+](http://www.pitt.edu/~emotion/ck-spread.htm) and [JAFFE](http://www.kasrl.org/jaffe.html). You can apply for or directly download these two dataset.
